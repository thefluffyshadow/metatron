Programmer: Zachary Champion
Project:    metatron
Project Description:
            A program that generates programs in the same language in which the program itself is written.
            Metatron Jr. uses a genetic algorithm to breed programs in python; it writes down anything that works
            (runs without errors) and discard the rest.
            Individuals will be encoded as lists of lines of python which will not include the newline char.
            Gladiatorial combat will determine who gets the honor of breeding (tournament selection will decide breeding
            parents).
File:       Eugenics.py
File Description:
            Main genetic algorithm component.
